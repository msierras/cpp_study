/*
    Create a void function called roun() that rounds the value of its double argument to the nearest whole value.
    Have round() use a reference parameter and return the rounded result in this parameter. You can assume that all
    values to be rounded are positive. Demonstrate round() in a program. To solve this problem, you will need to use
    the modf() standard library function, which is shown here:
        
        double modf(double num, double *i);
    
    The modf function decomposes num into its integer and fractional parts. It returns the fractional portion
    and places the integer part in the variable pointed to by i. It requires the header <cmath>
